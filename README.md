# IUPUI-ADS-h611-FinalProject
# Draft of the write up will be here!

# FOR THE TA
I was planning on writing a write up here and then learning how to make animated videos the same way as 3Blue1Brown, all in python. 
However.... That was over ambitious (but still very possible! - just couldn't fit it in the time). I will be moving back to HackMD for the first and I suppose final submission - but hope this explains briefly why i picked GitHub for now but I didn't want to have to send you another URL. 


# Backpropagation by Alex Toon


"Feels to me like all back-propagation is the chain rule with a good PR team."



## Level - 0 Tutorial - What game are we playing?

Imagine you're doing a raid for the 67th time. Every run you change something, use new gear, respec your character, try a new strategy. You want to optimize your character to do the most damage possible or tank the most hits.

In this paper, I aim to explain backpropagation through the lens of a video game RPG character optimization. backpropagation is the algorithm that allows neural networks to learn from their mistakes and improve over time.

## Level - 1 Meet the build - Turning a neural net into a character sheet 

## Level - 2 Boss fight - Forward pass & cost

## Level - 3 watching the replay - Chain rule and deltas 

## Level - 4 respecing your character - Weights & psueduo code

## Level - 5 New Game + - Putting it all together
